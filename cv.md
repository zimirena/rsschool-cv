## About me

A few years ago I discovered the world of web development by learning HTML, CSS and later PHP from various online resources.

I've already had some freelance experience: sometimes I take on small tasks like customizing or fixing bugs on existing websites, and building web pages based on design mockups. Lately I've been doing this more frequently, and I’ve come to accept that this should be my profession.

However, I feel that my knowledge is still unsystematic, fragmented and insufficient. That’s why I've set a goal for myself to fill in the gaps, learn modern development standards, and adopt best practices. Eventually I see myself as a full-stack developer.


## Skills

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, jQuery, Figma  
**Backend:** PHP


## Code example

**Task description:**
> This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.

```
function multiply(a, b){
  a * b
}
```

**My solution:**

```
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b;
}
```
